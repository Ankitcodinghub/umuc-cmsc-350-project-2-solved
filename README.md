1. Specification

Design, write and test a program that accepts an arithmetic expression of unsigned integers in postfix notation in which the tokens are separated by spaces and builds and processes the arithmetic expression tree that represents that expression.

The main class will be P2GUI. It should create a Swing based GUI shown below:

Pressing the Construct Tree button should cause the following: (i) the arithmetic expression tree that represents the entered postfix expression will be constructed, (ii) using that tree, the corresponding fully parenthesized infix expression should be generated and displayed in the GUI and finally (iii) a file should be generated that contains the 3-address format instructions corresponding to the arithmetic expression. These topics, including relevant classes for implementing and processing an expression tree, are discussed in the week 4 reading ‚ÄúBinary Trees, Expression Trees, BST (AVL) trees, and B-Trees‚Äù section II ‚ÄúExpression Trees‚Äù.

The above example should produce the following output file containing the 3-address instructions:

Add R0 5 9

Sub R1 3 R0

Mul R2 2 3

Div R3 R1 R2

It is not necessary to reuse registers within an expression as shown in the above mentioned reading and you can assume there are as many available as needed. Each new expression should, however, begin using registers starting at R0.

operands such as 2a, which are not valid integers. If an invalid token is detected, a checked custom exception InvalidTokenException should be thrown and caught by the main class and an appropriate error message should be displayed. Below is an example:

Your program should compile without errors.

In addition the following design constraints should be followed: declare all instance variables private; avoid the duplication of code.

2. Submission requirements

2. The solution description document P2SolutionDescription (.pdf or .doc / .docx) containing the following:

(1) Assumptions, main design decisions, error handling;

(2) A UML class diagram that includes all classes you wrote. Do not include predefined classes. You need only include the class name for each individual class, not the variables or methods;

(3) A table of test cases including the test cases that you have created to test the program. The table should have 5 columns indicating (i) what aspect is tested, (ii) the input values, (iii) the expected output, (iv) the actual output and (v) if the test case passed or failed. Each test case will be defined in a table row.

(4) Relevant screenshots of program execution;

(5) Lessons learned from the project;

Grading Rubric:
